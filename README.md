 We propose a system that generates concise, grammatically correct summaries of large texts by combining CFGs for sentence structure modeling with Pushdown Automata (PDA) for parsing. Our
approach ensures syntactic validity and coherence in the summarized content that has potential to revolutionize automated document summarization
